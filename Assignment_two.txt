# Question 1: Difference between "cat echo" and "echo cat"
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ cat echo
cat: echo: No such file or directory
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ # "cat echo" prints/displays the contents of a file (the file in this case is "echo")
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ # Since there is no file named "echo", it prints/displays an error
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ echo cat
cat
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ # "echo cat" prints/displays the argument provided ("cat" is the argument here)

# Question 2: Full pathname vs relative pathname
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ pwd
/home/student/krupadhruva
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ # "/home/student/krupadhruva" is the full path name and not relative to any directory
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ ls /tmp/../home/student/krupadhruva/
cis18a  public_html
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ # "/tmp/../home/student/krupadhruva/" is a relative path since we see ".." component(s) in the path
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ # In the above path, ".." is one directory above relative to "/tmp" directory

# Question 3: Hidden files
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ ls
cis18a  public_html
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ ls -a
.   .bash_history  .bash_profile  .cache  .config  .mozilla     .ssh
..  .bash_logout   .bashrc        cis18a  .kshrc   public_html  .viminfo
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ # File names that begin with a "." are hidden and are only listed using "-a" option in "ls"

# Question 4: Usage of "tail" command
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ tail .bash_history | nl
     1	# echo simply states or echoes while $ extracts the value from the variable HOME
     2	man uname
     3	# uname is used to get information about the system; "uname -m": prints machine hardware name
     4	uname -m
     5	man hostname
     6	# hostname is used to show or set the hostname; "hostname": displays computer hostname
     7	hostname
     8	man who
     9	# who shows who all are logged in; "who": list of students that are logged in
    10	who
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ # "tail .bash_history | nl" displays the last 10 lines of a given file ".bash_history". "nl" is used to show the line numbers
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ tail -5 .bash_history | nl
     1	# hostname is used to show or set the hostname; "hostname": displays computer hostname
     2	hostname
     3	man who
     4	# who shows who all are logged in; "who": list of students that are logged in
     5	who
[krupadhruva@voyager ~]$ # "tail -5" displays the last 5 lines of a given file
