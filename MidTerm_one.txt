Question 1: Write a (ie one) cmd line to print the number of lines in the file /etc/passwd

    # Preferred: wc can be used to show the number of lines in a file
    $ wc -l /etc/passwd

    # Alternate: nl prints the line number against each line and we take the last output (showing the total line count)
    $ nl /etc/passwd | tail -1

Question 2: List the names of any three Linux filters that you have used in Linux OS

    1. paginating through a long file: less

    Example: Paginate through file '.bashrc' in home directory
    $ cat ~/.bashrc | less

    2. Show first 'n' lines in a file: head

    Example: Show top 10 lines  from file '.bashrc' in home directory
    $ cat ~/.bashrc | head -10

    3. Show last 'n' lines in a file: tail

    Example: Show last 10 lines  from file '.bashrc' in home directory
    $ cat ~/.bashrc | tail -10

Question 3: Identify cmd name, options if any, arguments for the following cmd lines:

    3a: ls -ld /tmp /usr/bin

        cmd: ls
        option 1: l
        option 2: d
        argument 1: /tmp
        argument 2: /usr/bin

    3b: cat /etc/passwd /etc/group

        cmd: cat
        argument 1: /etc/passwd
        argument 2: /etc/group

Question 4: Identify full pathname and relative pathname in the following:

    4a: ../usr/bin

        Relative pathname

    4b: /home/student/john/project

        Full pathname
